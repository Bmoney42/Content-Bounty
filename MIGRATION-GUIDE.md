# 🚀 Migration Guide: Master to Main Branch

## 🎯 **Current Situation**

- **Master Branch**: Contains all our security fixes but has outdated design
- **Main Branch**: Has the clean, modern design from production site
- **Production Site**: Currently using main branch (the good one!)

## 🔧 **Migration Steps**

### **Step 1: Create Main Branch with Security Fixes**

```bash
# Run the migration script
chmod +x migrate-to-main.sh
./migrate-to-main.sh
```

This will:
- ✅ Create a new `main` branch from `master`
- ✅ Include all our security fixes
- ✅ Push to remote repository

### **Step 2: Update Vercel Configuration**

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Find your project** (Content-Bounty)
3. **Go to Settings → Domains**
4. **Update production domain** (`creatorbounty.xyz`) to point to `main` branch
5. **Remove domain** from the old `master` branch deployment

### **Step 3: Test Production Site**

1. **Visit**: https://www.creatorbounty.xyz/
2. **Verify**:
   - ✅ Clean, modern design is preserved
   - ✅ Security fixes are working
   - ✅ Role switching works
   - ✅ No demo credentials are exposed

### **Step 4: Clean Up (After Testing)**

```bash
# Run the cleanup script
chmod +x cleanup-master.sh
./cleanup-master.sh
```

## 🎯 **What We're Achieving**

### **Before Migration:**
- ❌ Production site: Clean design, NO security fixes
- ❌ Master branch: Security fixes, outdated design
- ❌ Two different codebases

### **After Migration:**
- ✅ Production site: Clean design + ALL security fixes
- ✅ Main branch: Everything in one place
- ✅ Single source of truth

## 🔒 **Security Features Being Added**

1. **Security Headers**
   - X-Frame-Options: DENY
   - Content Security Policy
   - X-XSS-Protection
   - X-Content-Type-Options

2. **Input Validation & Sanitization**
   - DOMPurify integration
   - Demo account prevention
   - XSS protection

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Login attempts: 5/15min
   - Signup: 3/hour
   - API calls: 100/min

4. **Role Switching**
   - Fiverr-style mode switching
   - Creator ↔ Business toggle

## 🚨 **Important Notes**

- **Backup**: Your current production site is safe
- **Rollback**: You can always revert if needed
- **Testing**: Test thoroughly before cleanup
- **Domain**: Keep `creatorbounty.xyz` pointing to main branch

## 🎉 **Expected Result**

Your production site will have:
- 🎨 The beautiful design from main branch
- 🔒 All security fixes from master branch
- ⚡ Role switching functionality
- 🛡️ Comprehensive security measures
- 🚫 No demo credentials exposed
